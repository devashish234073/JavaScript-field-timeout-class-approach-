# JavaScript-field-timeout-class-approach-

## Multiple textfields and button are used to create instance of "Elem" function which are structured as linked list. Thus each having link to the next. Thus passing the first element to the "Timer" class traverses the linked list and sets timeout for each after each key-up on a field.


While no changes are observed in a field a progress bar is displayed that represents the timeout. While the progress bar is reaching 0, if any key is pressed, progress bar fills again and timeout starts over again.
